📱 Project Overview

SportGlory is a web-based platform that celebrates the achievements of Indian athletes by providing a transparent and engaging system for sports award nominations, voting, and result announcements. Built with React.js and powered by Firebase, SportGlory empowers communities to recognize sports excellence with simplicity and trust.

A simple, intuitive nomination system

Transparent voting with real-time updates

Centralized result announcements and dashboards

Community-driven participation and recognition
